# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## About

This repository contains a deep learning model for flower recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of 4242 images of flowers from various sources, including Flickr, Google Images, and Yandex Images. The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification system capable of recognizing different types of flowers.

## Dataset

### Context

The dataset consists of 4242 images of flowers, categorized into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, and dandelion. The images were collected from various sources and have varying dimensions, with an average resolution of approximately 320x240 pixels.

### Content

    Classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion
    Number of Images: Around 800 photos per class
    Image Resolution: Varies, approximately 320x240 pixels

The dataset is available on Kaggle: Flowers Recognition Dataset

## Getting Started

   The flower recognition model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture hierarchical features from images

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify flower images. Feel free to modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing steps to improve performance and accuracy.
